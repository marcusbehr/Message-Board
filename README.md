# Message-Board
Final project for CSCI 2006

This project was done using PHP and MySQL

A user can access the webpage and see short blog posts made by users, but cannot post
in the blog until they sign up to the webpage. The database holds user information
and will use that to verify at the time of log in. The database also holds
the blog posts to be displayed on the main webpage.

The user can select blog posts they like and these blog posts will be saved
to an archive posts tab in the menu where they can view all of the
previously liked posts.

NOTE: need an archive.txt file in the directory for the archive posts to work
